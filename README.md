## Mandatory development workflow (2026-11-09)

Read **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** and the official **[Integrated PR and isolated staging policy](docs/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md)** before changing code. Each PR must extend the complete existing app, be synchronized with current `main`, and use a separate testing environment for all writes, Auth, databases and external side effects. A preview that writes to production is **not safe for functional testing**. Test old and new authenticated/mobile/desktop flows together, maintain an append-only SU log, and obtain owner approval before merging. This documentation records the target process; it does **not** claim staging has been provisioned.
